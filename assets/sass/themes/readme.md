# THEMES FOLDER

On large sites and applications, it is not unusual to have different themes. There are certainly different ways of dealing with themes but I personally like having them all in a themes/ folder.

- _theme.scss
- _admin.scss

*Note:* This is very project-specific and is likely to be non-existent on many projects.
